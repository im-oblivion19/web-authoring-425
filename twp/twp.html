    <h1>Item of the Week: Used Mask</h1>
    <img src = "images/mask_image_updated.jpeg"width=400>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is image of a face mask. It's black in color and feels slightly crispy and not smooth because it is a disposable mask. I acquired this mask during the COVID quarantine, when my family brought a huge pack  of 150 face masks.
        We eventually switched to using cotton reusable masks, so we hardly resorted to using these disposable ones. 
        I carried about the unused 100ish masks that we had left from the pack to my dorm when I moved in for the Spring semester. 
        I only first used it last week, because I had to clean a dusty area of my room. The mask is good for short term use, but not the most comfortable one since breathing through it is like breathing through a 
        thin napkin. 
        It has a slight smell too. I'm getting rid of it because I already used it for very long and it also slipped out of my hand and fell on the ground, so it's dirty. </p>

    <h2>Anecdote</h2>
    <p>After hardly being used for 6 years since the time they were brought, it was finally time to wear the mask. 
        Since I moved in after not being in my dorm for a month, my entire room needed cleaning. There is a gap between the 
        drawer cabinet and the wardrobe that was full of dust and needed to be de-cluttered and vacuumed. So I took the mask 
        out of the pack, and put it on.</p><p>As I adjusted it over my nose and dragged it below my chin, I noticed that it was ridiculously
        stuffy. It quickly fogged up my glasses. I guess that is the whole point of a mask, since it's supposed to protect you from the
         air around you which could contain viruses, harmful germs, or in my case, a lot of dust. I cleaned up the area, and the mask was
          very helpful since it barely let any dust into my nose and mouth.</p> <p> After I was done, it made sense to discard it, since the 
          front side of it was probably full of dust. And as I was taking it off, I dropped it on the ground. Honestly, anything that 
          gets dropped on the floor of a college dorm should not be used and discarded as soon as possible. So, I threw it away.</p>
