<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>I decided to record my trash for this week because I’ve always been curious about how the trash cans that we use fill up so quickly. Now that I live in a dorm on college, I take my trash out approximately once a week, which is way less frequent than when I lived at home. The trash cans in our home are pretty small and so trash needed to be taken out literally every single morning. However, since the trash can in my dorm is comparitively huge, and the discarded items belong to just me rather than my entire family, it gives me a really good opportunity to just observe my trash over the week and record the objects I’m choosing to get rid of.
</p><p>Common items in my trash include used napkins and empty food/drink containers. But I really wanted to go beyond those items and take a look at the “niche” items that I end up throwing away. As I documented my trash for this week, I found that there is indeed a lot of variety in my trash, and there is a lot more to my trash than just piles and piles of used tissue papers. So, I present to you, my trash of the week!

<h2 id="sec1">Overview</h2>

<p>This week’s disposal activity felt more routine than surprising, especially compared to earlier weeks when I was more consciously noticing every item I threw away. Most of what I got rid of this week consisted of small, everyday objects that had quietly reached the end of their usefulness rather than dramatic or emotionally charged items. What stood out to me was how many of these things lingered longer than they should have; kept around out of habit, convenience, or procrastination rather than any real purpose.</p>
<p>I also noticed a pattern of items that failed gradually rather than all at once. Several objects stopped functioning properly over time, but I continued to use them or store them anyway, adapting around their flaws until they became unusable. This made me realize how often I normalize inconvenience instead of addressing it, whether by replacing something promptly or disposing of it when it no longer serves its function.</p>
<p>Hygiene/Health related items</p>
<p>The first category consists of items you would use for cleaning/medical purposes. This includes a used face mask, an exhausted tissue box, expired Advil, and an old toothbrush. I acquired the face mask during the COVID pandemic. It was a use-and-throw type mask, that I never ended up using until very recently. I used the face mask to protect my nose and mouth when I was cleaning a dusty part of my room. I ended up throwing it away because the front part of it was full of fine dust. The Advil must’ve been bought about one or two years ago, since it only expired last week. The bottle was still more than half full of capsules, which means I barely consumed it. It is the most effective painkiller for me, but my mom constantly urges me to avoid taking it unless absolutely nessecary, because apparently Ibuprofen isn’t the best for your health. The green toothbrush was used for over three months since I purchased it from Walmart. It was finally time to throw it away since bristles were sticking out at awkward angles, and it’s best to change your toothbrush once every two-three months. The new toothbrush I bought was the exact same one, since I really liked how smooth and soft the bristles were. The tissue box barely lasted two or three weeks, since I caught a cold about a week after I opened the box. Since I was sick, I ran through the tissues really quickly, and I had to replace the box way sooner than I normally do.  </p>
<p2>Broken/Malfunctioning items</p2>
<p>This category consists of items I would ideally never want to throw away, but I sadly had to because they stoppped working the way they were supposed to. These include headphones, a broken pencil, and an attachable phone stand. The headphones were a pair of bluetooth earbuds, that I bought off of Amazon. I wanted my earbuds to have the noise cancelling feature, but unfortunately that means you have to spend a good chunk of money. To work around this, I got a pair that was cheap, noise cancelling, but was of a company I had never heard of before. As you can expect, they stopped working after only 4 months. I guess it serves me right for buying those, since you can never really trust products which are half the price of the normal price. The next item is a broken pencil, which I never truly thought I would have to get rid of, since it’s a mechanical one and can easily be reused with leads. I got it right before I came to college. I remember, I was working on some calculus problems, and while flicking the pencil around my fingers, it slipped out of my hand and I dropped it. As I picked it up, I noticed that a small part of the plastic tip had broken off. I still tried writing with it, but it was really shaky and unstable. Since I could no longer use it, I threw it away. The final item in this category is an attachable phone stand. It is a small piece of metal with a hinge that you can stick to the back of your phone, right on your phone case. When you open the hinge, your phone can stand by itself on any flat surface, and in any orientation you want, landscape or portrait. I bought it from Amazon because I spend a lot of time on FaceTime calls and it’s very convienient to set your phone on a surface so you can be comfortable, and use both your hands while talking to the person. However, as time passed the adhesive which attached the metal to my phonse case gradually weakened. The phone stand kept coming off, and I repeatedly had to attach it again. This went on and on, until one day the stickiness was completely gone and I couldn’t attach it no matter how hard I pressed it. I ended up disposing it since it was no longer of use.  </p>
<p2>Wear-and-tear items</p2>
<p>The final group consists of small, easily overlooked utility items: a used Ziploc bag and a wire tie that had been repurposed multiple times to shorten long cables. I used the Ziploc bag to store my moisturizer when I was carrying it in my bag. You can’t really expect a medium sized bottle of moisturizer to not leak when it’s kept in a bagpack full of other items crowding around it, hence why I used the Ziploc. When it was time to take it out, the bag was foggy and had bits of cream in it’s inner surface, and I couldn’t really reuse the Ziploc. I ended up throwing it away. The final item is perhaps the most unique and unsual item this week: a wire tie. It’s a small plastic tie that comes with any electronic item that has a long calbe. Since the tie is foldable and can hold at the same time, I used it to shorten the wire of my mouse. As time went by, the tie started to grow weak and eventually tore off. I tried fixing it with tape and reusing it, but that didn’t last either. It eventually had to end up in my trash.</p>

<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>To wrap up this week’s documentation, this set of discarded items reinforced how much of my waste comes from quiet, routine moments rather than big, memorable decisions. Most of what I threw away this week was functional until it suddenly wasn’t, and many of these objects stayed with me longer than necessary simply because they were easy to ignore. Paying attention to these patterns has made me more aware of how convenience, habit, and gradual wear shape what eventually becomes trash.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to next week, I plan to be more intentional about noticing items as they approach the end of their usefulness rather than only acknowledging them once they are ready to be discarded. Thank you to everyone who took the time to visit and engage with this week’s entry. If you have thoughts, questions, or similar observations about your own waste habits, feel free to share or reach out, since conversation and comparison are part of what makes this project meaningful.</p>
